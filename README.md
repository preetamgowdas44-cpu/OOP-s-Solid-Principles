# OOP's-Solid-Principles

This repository contains simple Python examples demonstrating the SOLID principles of Object-Oriented Programming.  
I wrote this as a practice exercise after learning from the *"Python in Kannada" YouTube channel (Part-21)*.

---

## What is Included?
- Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- Open / Closed Principle (OCP)
- Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
- Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

Each principle is shown with a minimal example script for clarity and revision.
